KSOC scans for CVEs in your images as part of your GitHub Actions CI workflow.

This action is using Grype to scan for CVEs in given image.

## Example Usage

Build a local image and scan it for CVEs. It will fail the workflow if any CVE with `medium` severity is found. It will ignore CVEs with IDs `CVE-2021-1234` and `CVE-2021-5678`. Default output format will be used (`table`) which will be printed to the standard output of the action.

```yaml
name: ksoc-image-scan

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  ksoc-image-scan:
    permissions:
      # only required for workflows in private repositories
      actions: read
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Local Container
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          tags: localbuild/testimage:latest
          push: false
          load: true
      - name: KSOC Image Scan
        uses: ksoclabs/image-scan-action@v0.0.4
        with:
          fail_on_severity: medium
          ignore_cves: |
            CVE-2021-1234
            CVE-2021-5678
          image: localbuild/testimage:latest
```

This action also supports SARIF output format. Note the additional permission `security-events: write` which is required to upload security report.

```yaml
name: ksoc-image-scan

  pull_request:

jobs:
  ksoc-image-scan:
    permissions:
      # required for all workflows
      security-events: write
      # only required for workflows in private repositories
      actions: read
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Local Container
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          tags: localbuild/testimage:latest
          push: false
          load: true
      - name: KSOC Image Scan
        id: scan
        uses: ksoclabs/image-scan-action@v0.0.4
        with:
          fail_on_severity: medium
          format: sarif
          ignore_cves: |
            CVE-2021-1234
            CVE-2021-5678
          image: localbuild/testimage:latest
      - name: Upload Image Scan SARIF Report
        if: success() || failure()
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.sarif }}
```
